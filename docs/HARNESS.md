# Harness

The project goal is to provide a reusable operating harness that lets humans and
agents turn a future product spec into safe, validated work.

The app is what users touch. The harness is what agents touch.

## Mental Model

```text
------------------+
| Human intent    |
+------------------+
         |
         v
+------------------+
| Feature intake   |
+------------------+
         |
         v
+------------------+
| Story packet     |
+------------------+
         |
         v
+------------------+
| Agent work loop  |
+------------------+
         |
         v
+------------------+
| Product delta    |
+------------------+
         |
         v
+------------------+
| Validation proof |
+------------------+
         |
         v
+------------------+
| Harness delta    |
+------------------+
         |
         v
+------------------+
| Next intent      |
+------------------+
```

Every task has two possible outputs:

1. Product delta: app code, tests, API shape, data model, or product docs.
2. Harness delta: docs, templates, validation expectations, backlog items, or
   decision records that make the next task easier.

## Harness v0 Scope

Harness v0 includes:

- Agent entrypoint.
- Empty product documentation structure.
- Feature intake and risk lanes.
- Story templates.
- Decision log template.
- Validation report template.
- Test matrix placeholder.
- Harness growth backlog.

Harness v0 deliberately excludes:

- A project-specific `SPEC.md`.
- Pre-sliced product domains.
- A locked application stack.
- App source scaffolding.
- Package scripts.
- Test runner config.
- CI workflows.
- Database migrations or infrastructure.

Those should arrive only when a selected story needs them.

## Source Hierarchy

```text
User-provided spec or prompt
  input material for first buildout or future changes

docs/product/*
  current product contract derived from accepted input

docs/stories/*
  story-sized work packets and historical evidence

docs/TEST_MATRIX.md
  behavior-to-proof control panel

docs/decisions/*
  why the contract changed
```

Before implementation, product docs describe intent. After implementation,
product docs plus executable tests become the living contract.

## Spec Lifecycle

Harness v0 starts without a tracked project spec. When the human provides a
specification, treat it as input material, not as a permanent operating manual.
Use it to populate product docs, story packets, architecture decisions, and
validation expectations during the first buildout.

After the specification has been decomposed, do not keep extending it as the
living product plan. Ongoing work should update the smaller product docs,
stories, test matrix, and decision records.

Ongoing work should enter the harness as one of these input types:

- New spec: a project specification that needs to become product docs and
  initial story candidates.
- Spec slice: a selected behavior from the provided spec.
- Change request: a bounded behavior change, bug fix, or product refinement.
- New initiative: a larger product area that needs multiple stories.
- Maintenance request: dependency, architecture, performance, security, or
  operational work.
- Harness improvement: a process, template, proof, or agent-instruction change.

The spec-to-work loop is:

```text
human intent or supplied spec
  -> classify input type
  -> update or create product contract
  -> create story packet or initiative notes when needed
  -> define validation proof
  -> implement or document the blocker
  -> update product docs, stories, test matrix, and decisions
  -> capture harness friction
```

Large product areas should use scoped initiative notes instead of a second
monolithic specification. An initiative should explain the goal, affected
product docs, candidate stories, validation shape, open decisions, and exit
criteria. If initiative work becomes a repeated pattern, add a template or
proposal to `docs/HARNESS_BACKLOG.md`.

## Growth Rule

The harness grows from friction.

When an agent is confused, repeats manual reasoning, needs a new validation
command, discovers a missing rule, or sees a recurring failure pattern, it must
either improve the harness directly or add a proposal to `HARNESS_BACKLOG.md`.

## Blocked High-Risk Reselection Guard

When a high-risk story is already documented as blocked and its unblockers have
not changed, autonomous sprint rounds should not reselect it just to restate the
same blocker. Select a smaller unblocked story or harness improvement instead.
If none exists, stop after citing the existing blocker evidence and ask for the
missing human approval inputs.

Reselect a blocked high-risk story only when one of these is true:

- The human supplied new approval inputs or narrowed the implementation path.
- The story packet lacks concrete blocker evidence or decision inputs.
- A product, architecture, or validation contract changed since the blocker was
  recorded.

## Autonomous Sprint Selection Guard

Autonomous full-stack sprint rounds must choose from the Full-Stack MVP Sprint
Sequence in `docs/stories/backlog.md`. Before implementation, record a sequence
preflight that marks each sequence item as implemented, skipped, blocked, or the
selected candidate with concrete evidence. For non-UI selections, also record
which earlier or already-backed browser UI gaps were checked; if an unblocked UI
over an existing safe server query/action boundary is missing, switch to that UI
slice first.

Stale progression notes in old prompts, sprint logs, or repository status prose
must not override the current backlog, story evidence, and `docs/TEST_MATRIX.md`.

## Dependency Audit Policy

When a sprint installs or updates dependencies and the package manager reports
audit findings, record the severity/count in story evidence or the final summary.
Do not run forced audit fixes, dependency downgrades, or broad package upgrades
without human approval, because those changes can alter product behavior outside
the selected slice.

## Validation Ladder

The current quick validation commands are:

```text
validate:quick
  typecheck and unit tests

smoke:routes
  default App Router route smoke for /, /login, /dashboard, and /instructor/dashboard
```

Future checks should be introduced only when selected stories need them:

```text
test:integration
  backend, database, provider, or service checks as the stack requires

test:e2e
  user-visible end-to-end flows

test:platform
  shell, mobile, desktop, or deployment smoke checks as the stack requires

test:release
  full suite, log checks, and performance smoke
```

Agents must not claim these commands pass until they exist and have been run.
